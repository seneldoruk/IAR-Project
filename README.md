This is a project I've made for the course "Integration Architectures" in 2022 which uses Mongo, Angular, Express and Node stack to integrate two different external services and some custom business logic on top of it. The aim is to create a platform where the bonuses for employees can be  calculated and approved automatically based on their performance.
